Iris Dataset: Another widely used dataset in data science courses. This one is especially good for learning Classification Models. It contains these columns: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width, Name. Fraud Dataset:I found this dataset from the course Applied Data Science with Python Specialization in Coursera. We used for Classification Models. A credit card fraud detection project looks good in a portfolio.Olympic Dataset:This dataset has information on the Olympic results. Each row contains the data of a country. This dataset will give you a taste of data cleaning to start with I learned Python’s libraries like Numpy and Pandas using this dataset.
